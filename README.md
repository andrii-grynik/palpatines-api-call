# Palpatines-api-call
Lets make some calls. 

Node version used: v21.2.0

Please clone the repo and run nmp i in proper root ion order to install dependencies. 

In order to start:
run node index.js 

##Issues I ran into:

ran into some issues with reaching api with proper format, but got that settled. 
Swapi data gets pulled with .co and at some poing it was changed to .dev, so I worked around it 

##Future improvements: 

Separating and compartmentalizing for the index.js in order to make it easier to manage and have separate file for easy functionality changes. 

Removal of global variables. 

My data filtering is a bit brute and I would start with improving and optimizing it.
